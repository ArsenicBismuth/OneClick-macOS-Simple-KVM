## IMPORTANT
You must download or clone this GitHub repository before you begin
Do not use forks of `notAperson535/OneClick-macOS-Simple-KVM` as I update this repository a lot, and forks are usually behind.
This is NOT the install guide for Windows, that is located [here](windows-install.md).
Don't use the Just-OpenCore branch of this, it is not updated ever.

If you do not see files in this guide, or if you want to update your version, which I recommend doing at least one a month, run this command
```
git pull --rebase
```
