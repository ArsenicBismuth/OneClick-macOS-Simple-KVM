## IMPORTANT

#### 5/19/2022 - New website look! Hope you like it!

#### 4/27/2022 - This repository used to be attached to [macOS-Simple-KVM](https://github.com/foxlet/macOS-Simple-KVM) as a fork, but do to a number of reasons I have decided to detach it. If this causes any problems, specifically in the git CLI, then feel free to post and issue and I will respond as soon as I can.

You must download or clone this GitHub repository before you begin
Do not use forks of `notAperson535/OneClick-macOS-Simple-KVM` as I update this repository a lot, and forks are usually behind.

If you do not see files in this guide, or if you want to update your version, which I recommend doing at least one a month, run this command
```
git pull --rebase
```
If that throws an error, try this command
```
git pull origin master
```
